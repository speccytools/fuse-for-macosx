	    cause emulation to run until that event occurs.
	  + Breakpoints can now be set relative to a RAM page, rather than
	    purely by address.
	  + Breakpoints can now be set to trigger a specified number of

	    it was used for.
	  + The GTK+ tape browser no longer stops emulation.
	  + Look for ROMs and library files relative to the Fuse

	    dealing with a non-installed copy of Fuse.
	  + Use $TMPDIR for temporary files if it's specified.
	  + Warn if the current tape has been modified before its contents
	    are lost.

	* Fuse 0.6.1 released.

	* A Z80 core rewrite such that it's now generated from the regular
	  patterns in the instruction set. This shouldn't have any effect
	  as yet, but will make performance enhancements easier to do in
	  the future (Philip Kendall).

	* On the TC2068, the ROM traps apply only when in the EXROM and
	  memory contention applies only in the HOME bank (Fredrick

	  and Philip Kendall; based on the same feature in ScummVM).

	* Transparent monitor/debugger (Philip Kendall).

	* A rewrite of the display code to update only those rectangles
	  which have been changed, rather than entire lines. Performance
	  improvement, and also allows effects similar to flipping between

	* Memory pages 1, 3, 5 and 7 (not 4, 5, 6 and 7) are contended
	  on the 128K/+2 (Philip Kendall, with thanks to Steve Snake and
	  Mark Woodmass).

	* Get the mask right for the 128K/+2 memory control port (Philip
	  Kendall, with thanks to Mark Woodmass).

	* Add File/Save Screen option to save the current screen to a .png
	  file (Philip Kendall).

	  support libraries (libspectrum, lib765, libdsk, etc) in
	  non-system directories (Philip Kendall).

	* Make keysyms.c be UI-specific, rather than containing
	  information for all UIs (Darren Salt).

	  (Darren Salt/Philip Kendall).

	* TC2048 support (Fredrick Meunier).

	* Z80 core fixes: timing of OTDR and interrupt routines,
	  R register during interrupt and HALT and contention of
	  LD (nnnn),A (Philip Kendall, with thanks to Mark Woodmass
	  and Boris Donko).

	* Sound improvements: add beeper pseudo stereo and remove
	  beeper fade out (Russell Marks).

	  slow by up to (length of last instruction) t-states) (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Don't write to the printer unless we get a valid stop bit
	  (Russell Marks).

	* Open the sound devices non-blocking to avoid hangs on some
	  systems (reported by Erik Kunze, fixed by Alexander Yurchenko).

	* Don't write SLT data to .z80 files unless some actually exists
	  (reported by Russell Marks, fixed by Philip Kendall).

	* Search a system-wide directory for the ROMs; see Debian's
	  spectrum-roms package for why this will be useful (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Get the lengths of ROMs correct when munmap(2)ing them (Darren
	  Salt/Philip Kendall).

	* Add a small document describing the preferred coding style for
	  Fuse (Philip Kendall).

2002-02-04  Philip Kendall  <pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Version 0.4.1 released.

	* Add contention of memory and io ports. Should make multicolour
	  effects better (Philip Kendall).

	* Emulation of reading from unattached ports (e.g. #FF). Makes some
	  more games (e.g. Sidewize) work (Philip Kendall).

	* Add a keyboard picture -- see the Help menu (Philip Kendall,
	  Russell Marks).

	* Support for .slt files (Philip Kendall, Darren Salt).

	* Support for the ZX Printer (48K), serial printer (128K/+2)
	  and parallel printer (+2A) (Russell Marks).

	* Add the ability to select a machine type directly, rather than
	  cycling through the available machines (Philip Kendall).

	* Add command-line options; see the man page for details (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Lots of improvements to the widgets to make them much more
	  similar to the GTK+ menus (Philip Kendall).

	* Cleaner shutdown on 'impossible' conditions; especially useful
	  with the SVGAlib UI (Philip Kendall).

	* Add 'tape rewind' and 'tape clear' options (Philip Kendall).

	* Make tzxlist able to deal with multiple files, and give it
	  a man page (Darren Salt).

	* Man page update (Russell Marks).

	* Remove coredump if an empty .tzx file was loaded (Philip Kendall).

	* Various bits of codebase reorganisation. Most significant is the
	  move of each UI to its own directory (Philip Kendall).

	* Fix a fairly major thinko in libspectrum which meant that it
	  was using approximately twice as much memory as it needed to
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* Things probably of more interest to developers:
	  + A --enable-warnings option to configure to turn on lots more
	    warning options if you're using gcc.
	  + Detect gcc properly in configure.in.
	  + Remove many of the warnings generated when --enable-warnings
	    is used.
	  + Add a hacking/ui.txt file giving details on how to implement
	    a new UI for Fuse.
	  (Philip Kendall).

2001-12-20  Philip Kendall  <pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Version 0.4.0 released.

	* The big one: .tzx support. Fuse will now read in all the common
	  block types from .tzx files (Philip Kendall).

	* Ability to write out tape files (Philip Kendall).

	* Various improvements to the widget dialog boxes: cursor keys,
	  Page Up, Page Down, Home and End all do what you would expect,
	  remove the use of `scandir' function to improve inter-Unix
	  compatibility, append `/' to directories to make them more
	  obvious, stop the hangs if you tried to start a widget whilst
	  one was active. (Philip Kendall, Russell Marks).

	* .z80 snapshots: deal with the case of the end marker being
	  preceded by 0x00 or 0x00 0xed (Philip Kendall).

	* Lots of sound improvements (Russell Marks).

	* Addition of tzxlist utility to list the blocks found in a .tzx
	  file (Philip Kendall).

	* Have a man page (Russell Marks).

	* Emulation of the AY-3-8912's register 15 (Russell Marks).

	* Kempston joystick emulation (Russell Marks).

2001-10-07  Philip Kendall  <pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Versions 0.3.2 and 0.3.2.1 released.

	* Added file selection dialog boxes for snapshot and tape loading,
	  and (GTK+ only) snapshot saving (Philip Kendall, Matan Ziv-Av).

	* Allowed changing of Issue 2/3 keyboard at run-time. (Philip
	  Kendall).
	
	* Basically complete rewrite of the tape handling routines (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Allow `slow' tape loading with border effects, sound, et al.
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* Changed the default install location to `/usr/local' (Philip
 	  Kendall).

	* Generate keysyms.c from keysyms.dat; allows me automatically
	  keep the Xlib/GTK+ and svgalib key tables in sync (Philip
	  Kendall).

	* Beginnings of `widgets': dialog boxes etc. for non-GTK+ user
  	  interfaces (Matan Ziv-Av, Philip Kendall).

2001-08-13  Philip Kendall  <pak21-fuse@srcf.ucam.org>

	* Version 0.3.1 released.

	* Removed need for glib (but it's still used if present)
	  (Matan Ziv-Av).

	* Separated OSS (Linux) specific sound code out into separate
	  files, removed most floating-point calculations from the AY
	  code, added support for 16-bit only devices, and added some
	  AY subsampling (Russell Marks).

	* Fuse now runs on a StrongARM 1110, using the new framebuffer
	  UI (Matan Ziv-Av).
	
	* Major tidy-up of display.c and event.c (Philip Kendall).

	* Implemented a `lazy write' scheme for the screen. Makes
	  rainbowing effects _much_ faster (and helps elsewhere as
	  well) (Philip Kendall).

	* Further improvements to the lazy write scheme - consecutive
	  lines which have changed are copied to the screen in one
	  block, rather than as separate lines (Philip Kendall).

	* Complete rewrite of the snapshot code; now handles .z80
	  and .sna snapshots (Philip Kendall).

	* Started separating some bits of code into subdirectories;
	  currently `libspectrum' for the snapshot code, and `z80'
	  for the Z80 core (Philip Kendall).

	* Added `AUTHORS' file (Philip Kendall).

	* Large rewrite of the code for changing machine type
	  (Philip Kendall).

	* Made `make install' work (Philip Kendall).

2001-01-31  Philip Kendall  <pak@ast.cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.3.0 released.

	* Fixed a large bug in the 48K snapshot saving routine.

	* Added rudimentary GTK+ interface.

	* Added svgalib interface (thanks to Matan Ziv-Av).

	* Made peripheral emulation much more modular, and added proper
	  decoding of ports.

	* Fixing timings for INI, OUTI, IND, OUTD and the repeated
	  versions (they were all one T-state too short).

	* Sound support under Linux (thanks to Russell Marks and Matan
	  Ziv-Av).

2000-12-17  Philip Kendall  <pak@ast.cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.2.1 released.

	* 2x2 and 3x3 displays now available.

	* Border emulation is back (with rainbowing).

	* Better keyboard emulation -- Abu Simbel Profanation now works
	  (and Issue 2 emulation is now available as a compile-time
	  option). Thanks to Santiago Romero for putting me on the track
	  of this bug.

	* Rewrite of Z80 core: one function call now runs the Z80 core
	  until something interesting happens, as determined by a list of
	  `events'. Thanks to Miklos Szeredi's `SpectEmu' for the
	  inspiration for this change.

2000-09-27  Philip Kendall  <pak@ast.cam.ac.uk>

	* Version 0.2.0 released

	* Version 0.1.3 released.

	* Added +2A emulation.

	* Can now save snapshots.

	* Screen rainbowing effects present.

	* Console version runs at the correct speed (almost. It runs at
	  50.00Hz, rather than the correct 50.01Hz (128K/+2) or 50.08Hz
	  (48K) ).

	* Added ROM trap to read from tape files.

	* Other bug fixes/improvements.

	  time :-)

	* Added +2 emulation (Just 128K emulation with different ROMs!)
	
	* Flashing characters implemented.

	* Bug fixes/improvements (Thanks to Erik Kunze for some helpful
