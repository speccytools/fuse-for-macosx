The Free Unix Spectrum Emulator (Fuse) 0.8.0.1
==============================================

Fuse (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator) was originally, and somewhat
unsurprisingly, an emulator of the ZX Spectrum (a popular 1980s home
computer, especially in the UK) for Unix. However, it has now also
been ported to Mac OS X, which may or may not count as a Unix variant
depending on your advocacy position and emulates some of the
better-known ZX Spectrum clones as well.

What Fuse does have:

* Working Spectrum 16K/48K/128K/+2/+2A/+3/+3e/SE, Timex TC2048,
  TC2068 and TS2068, Pentagon 128 and Scorpion ZS 256 emulation,
  running at true Speccy speed on any computer you're likely to try it
  on.
* Support for loading from .tzx files.
* Sound (on systems supporting the Open Sound System, SDL, or OpenBSD/
  Solaris's /dev/audio).
* Emulation of most of the common joysticks used on the Spectrum
  (including Kempston, Sinclair and Cursor joysticks).
* Emulation of some of the printers you could attach to a Spectrum.
* Support for the RZX input recording file format, including
  rollback and 'competition mode'.
* Emulation of the DivIDE, Interface I, Kempston mouse, Spectrum +3e,
  ZXATASP and ZXCF interfaces.

What you'll need to run Fuse
----------------------------

Unix, Linux, BSD, etc.

Required:

* X, SDL, svgalib or framebuffer support. If you have GTK+, you'll get
  a (much) nicer user interface under X.
* libspectrum: this is available from
  http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/libspectrum.php

Optional:

* If you want +3 and +3e support, you'll need John Elliott's lib765
  installed; get it from http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Unix/LibDsk/
  If you also have libdsk (from the same location) installed, you'll
  also get support for extended .dsk files (see 'THE .DSK FORMAT'
  section in fuse(1) for more details on this).
* Other libraries will give you some extended functionality:
  * libgcrypt: the ability to digitally sign input recordings (note that
    Fuse requires version 1.1.42 or later).
  * libpng: the ability to save screenshots
  * libxml2: the ability to load and save Fuse's current configuration
  * zlib: support for compressed RZX files
  * samplerate: support for better beeper sound quality; get it from
    http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/

If you've used Fuse prior to version 0.5.0, note that the external
utilities (tzxlist, etc) are now available separately from Fuse
itself. See http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/ for details.

Mac OS X

* Either the native port by Fredrick Meunier, or the original version
  will compile on OS X 10.3 (Panther) or later.

Building Fuse
-------------

To compile Fuse (see below for instructions for the OS X native port):

$ ./configure

There are now some options you can give to configure; `configure
--help' will list them all, but the most important are:

--with-fb		Use the framebuffer interface, rather than GTK+.
--with-sdl		Use the SDL interface, rather than GTK+.
--with-svgalib		Use the SVGAlib interface.
--without-gtk		Use the plain Xlib interface.

If glib is installed on your system, Fuse will use this for a couple
of things; however, it isn't necessary as libspectrum provides
replacements for all the routines used by Fuse.

Another useful option is `--with-local-prefix=DIRECTORY' which allows
you to specify that you have some the the libraries needed by Fuse in
`<DIRECTORY>/lib' and the necessary header files in
`<DIRECTORY>/include'. If you specify the `--prefix' option to tell
Fuse to install itself somewhere other than in /usr/local, that
directory will automatically be searched as well.

Then just:

$ make

and then

$ make install

if you want to place Fuse into the main directories on your system
(under /usr/local by default, although you can change this with the
--prefix argument to 'configure'). You'll probably need to be root to
do this bit.

Once you've got Fuse configured and built, read the man page :-)

Note that if you're using version of Fuse from CVS rather than one of
the released tarballs, you'll need to run `autogen.sh' before running
'configure' for the first time.

Building the OS X version of Fuse
---------------------------------

The native Cocoa port by Fredrick Meunier <fredm@spamcop.net> comes as
a set of Xcode projects for libbz2, lib765, libdsk, libgcrypt,
libspectrum and Fuse itself.

Closing comments
----------------

Fuse has its own home page, which you can find at:

http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/

and contains much of the information listed here. 

News of new versions of Fuse (and other important Fuse-related
announcements) are distributed via the fuse-emulator-announce mailing
list on SourceForge; see
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-emulator-announce
for details on how to subscribe and the like.

If you've got any bug reports, suggestions or the like for Fuse, or
just want to get involved in the development, this is coordinated via
the fuse-emulator-devel mailing list,
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-emulator-devel
and the Fuse project page on SourceForge,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse-emulator/

If you're interested in more general Speccy related discussions, visit
the Usenet group 'comp.sys.sinclair', but do read the FAQ
( http://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/index.html ) first!
